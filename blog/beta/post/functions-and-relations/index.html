<p>Many people seem to think that math is boring, unpleasant, and difficult to understand. These people are right; but I wish they weren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to understand that math is <em>basically</em> just a pen-and-paper board game, like dungeons and dragons. The rules of math are carefully designed to simulate the real world. It&rsquo;s not magic.</p>
<p>But math isn&rsquo;t taught this way. It&rsquo;s taught as an strict and arcane collection of rules that have to be memorized, on pain of bad test scores. Not much time is spent helping students understand <em>why</em> we choose these rules. A number of people are trying to change this (<a href="https://betterexplained.com/about/">[1]</a> <a href="https://graphicallinearalgebra.net/">[2]</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@3blue1brown?app=desktop">[3]</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Vihart/videos">[4]</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvPPXbo87ds">[5]</a>). There&rsquo;s a growing wave of math resources focusing on intuitive, sensory engagement with math.</p>
<p>I think resources like this are especially needed for modern pure math. For about a century, the style in professional math has been:</p>
<ul>
<li>no pictures in publications</li>
<li>all notation as concise and abstract as possible</li>
<li>use as many fancy tricks to describe your problem as you can think of</li>
<li>leave as much unsaid as possible</li>
</ul>
<p>This makes pure math seem much scarier than it really is. I want to make it friendlier.</p>
<p>This series will be an introduction to some important playing pieces in pure math: functions and relations. My overall goal is to convince you that functions look like this:</p>
<div class="centerer">
<img alt="A diagram with some purple balls on the left and orange squares on the right. The balls and squares are grouped into highlighted regions. Each region contains multiple balls, but only one square. All balls are contained in a region, but some squares are on their own." src="assets/Functions.drawio.svg" width="324pt" height="324pt">
</div>
<p>We&rsquo;ll get an intuitive understanding of what this means, and learn how to <em>prove</em> it &ndash; how to use it as a strategy in the game of formal math, if a pro mathematician challenges you to a duel.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s begin.</p>
<h2 id="whats-a-relation">What&rsquo;s a relation?</h2>
<p>First, we need to define our playing pieces. The most basic piece we&rsquo;ll use is called a <em>binary relation</em>. Before we start writing out equations and strict mathematical rules, let&rsquo;s try to get a general sense of what a binary relation looks like. There are multiple ways to draw them, but they&rsquo;re all connected.</p>
<h3 id="diagram-type-one-directed-graphs">Diagram type one: Directed Graphs</h3>
<p>My favorite way to draw binary relations is as <em>directed graphs</em>, or <em>digraphs</em>, which look like this:</p>
<!-- SCALE: drawio 1in -> 108pt --> 
<div class="centerer">
<img alt="Circles labeled 1,2,3,4. There are arrows going 1 to 2, 1 to 3, 3 to 4, 4 to 1" src="assets/R_Graph1.svg" width="324pt" height="324pt">
</div>
<p>A digraph is a collection of <em>nodes</em> &ndash; labeled circles &ndash; and a collection of <em>edges</em> &ndash; little arrows going between the nodes. We can model all sorts of situations with digraphs. For instance, a family tree can be represented as a digraph. We draw a node for each name and then draw arrows from parents to children:</p>
<div class="centerer">
<img alt="Circles labeled Cindy,Felix,Ray,Eileen,Rob,Louise,Jim,Mac. There are arrows going Cindy to Rob, Felix to Rob, Ray to Louise, Eileen to Louise, Rob to Jim, Rob to Mac, Louise to Jim, Louise to Mac" width="432pt" src="assets/Family_Digraph_1.svg">
</div>
<p>We can also draw digraphs of love triangles, by drawing edges from people to people they like:</p>
<div class="centerer">
<img alt="TODO" src="assets/Love Triangles.drawio.svg" width="756pt">
</div>
<p>Notice that nodes are allowed to have edges to themselves. Also, nodes don&rsquo;t have to have any edges. In the &ldquo;Romantic Comedy&rdquo; example, C is a sidekick who&rsquo;s not interested in A or B.</p>
<p>We can draw a digraph of which classes use which books in a school:</p>
<div class="centerer">
<img alt="TODO" class="extrapad" src="assets/Classes_Regular_Arrows.drawio.svg" width="648pt">
</div>
<p>Notice how this digraph is divided into two parts &ndash; the classes and the books. All the edges go from classes to books. Graphs like this are called &ldquo;bipartite&rdquo;, which means &ldquo;two parts&rdquo;.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have to use arrows to draw digraphs. We can use any shape we want, as long as the ends look different. For instance, we could use different colored circles:</p>
<div class="centerer">
<img alt="TODO" class="extrapad" src="assets/Classes_Multi_Arrows.drawio.svg" width="648pt">
</div>
<p>Or even add text labels:</p>
<div class="centerer">
<img alt="TODO" class="extrapad" src="assets/Classes_Multi_Arrows_2.drawio.svg" width="648pt">
</div>
<p>I like this because it&rsquo;s very clear what the edges mean. It&rsquo;s a lot of work to add all the labels though.
We can compromise by adding a legend:</p>
<div class="centerer">
<img alt="TODO" class="extrapad" src="assets/Classes_Multi_Arrows_Legend.drawio.svg" width="648pt">
</div>
<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve added legends, it&rsquo;s very easy to convert to our next way to draw relations: tables.</p>
<h3 id="diagram-type-two-two-column-tables">Diagram Type Two: Two-Column Tables</h3>
<p>Here is the Classes-Books relation, redrawn as a two-column table. We use the labels from the legend as column titles.</p>
<div class="centerer">
    <table class="diagramtable">
        <thead>
            <tr><th class="left">class</th><th class="right">book</th></tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr><td>English Lit 101</td><td>Hamlet</td></tr>
            <tr><td>English Lit 101</td><td>Moby Dick</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Whaling 101</td><td>Moby Dick</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Math 203</td><td>The Calculus Reader</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Astronomy 101</td><td>The Planetary System</td></tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
</div>
<p>This is less exciting, but more orderly.</p>
<p>We can also convert our other graphs into tables. For instance we can take the &ldquo;Coveting&rdquo; graph from before, add a legend, and convert it to a table:</p>
<div class="center-sequence">
<img alt="TODO" src="assets/Coveting_Legend.drawio.svg" class="opaque" width="250pt" height="250pt">
<div class="center-sequence-fence-post">↦</div>
<table class="diagramtable">
        <thead>
            <tr><th class="left">liker</th><th class="right">likes</th></tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr><td>B</td><td>A</td></tr>
            <tr><td>A</td><td>B</td></tr>
            <tr><td>C</td><td>B</td></tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
</div>
<p>Look at this for a minute to make sure you understand the translation.
If it helps, you can compare the &ldquo;Pining&rdquo; graph:</p>
<div class="center-sequence">
<img alt="TODO" src="assets/Pining_Legend.drawio.svg" class="opaque" width="250pt" height="250pt">
<div class="center-sequence-fence-post">↦</div>
<table class="diagramtable">
        <thead>
            <tr><th class="left">liker</th><th class="right">likes</th></tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr><td>B</td><td>A</td></tr>
            <tr><td>A</td><td>B</td></tr>
            <tr><td>B</td><td>C</td></tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
</div>
<p>In digraphs, we indicate the direction of a relationship with arrowheads (or colored circles). In tables, we indicate the direction of a relationship with the ordering of columns within a row.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one more way to draw relations&hellip;</p>
<h3 id="diagram-type-three-2d-plots">Diagram Type Three: 2D Plots</h3>
<p>This diagram type makes better use of 2D space. Here&rsquo;s the Coveting relation again, now drawn as a 2D plot:</p>
<div class="center-sequence">
<img alt="TODO" src="assets/Coveting_Legend.drawio.svg" class="opaque" width="250pt" height="250pt">
<table class="diagramtable">
        <thead>
            <tr><th class="left">liker</th><th class="right">likes</th></tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr><td>B</td><td>A</td></tr>
            <tr><td>A</td><td>B</td></tr>
            <tr><td>C</td><td>B</td></tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
<table class="twodplot">
        <tbody>
            <tr><th rowspan="3" class="right">likes</th>
                <th class="right">A</th>
                    <td><div class="square"></div></td>
                    <td class="selected"><div class="square">X</div></td>
                    <td><div class="square"></div></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th class="right">B</th>
                    <td class="selected"><div class="square">X</div></td>
                    <td><div class="square"></div></td>
                    <td class="selected"><div class="square">X</div></td>
            </tr>   
            <tr>
                <th class="right">C</th>
                    <td><div class="square"></div></td>
                    <td><div class="square"></div></td>
                    <td><div class="square"></div></td>
            </tr>
            <tr><td class="absent"></td><td class="absent"></td><th class="left">A</th><th class="left">B</th><th class="left">C</th></tr>
            <tr><td class="absent"></td><td class="absent"></td><th class="left" colspan="3">liker</th></tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
</div>
<p>And here&rsquo;s Pining:</p>
<div class="center-sequence">
<img alt="TODO" src="assets/Pining_Legend.drawio.svg" class="opaque" width="250pt" height="250pt">
<table class="diagramtable">

            <tr><td>B</td><td>A</td></tr>
            <tr><td>A</td><td>B</td></tr>
            <tr><td>B</td><td>C</td></tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
<table class="twodplot">
        <tbody>
            <tr><th rowspan="3" class="right">likes</th>
                <th class="right">A</th>
                    <td><div class="square"></div></td>
                    <td class="selected"><div class="square">X</div></td>
                    <td><div class="square"></div></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th class="right">B</th>
                    <td class="selected"><div class="square">X</div></td>
                    <td><div class="square"></div></td>
                    <td><div class="square"></div></td>
            </tr>   
            <tr>
                <th class="right">C</th>
                    <td><div class="square"></div></td>
                    <td class="selected"><div class="square">X</div></td>

            <tr><td class="absent"></td><td class="absent"></td><th class="left" colspan="3">liker</th></tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
</div>
<p>This new format kind of looks like a multiplication table, or like an x-y plot. We fill in a box if the person in that column likes the person in that row.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s apply this to our classes-books relation:</p>
<div class="center-sequence-column">

<p>(We&rsquo;ve used a trick here to take up less space. Because the class-books relation is bipartite &ndash; split into classes and books &ndash; we can put only classes on the bottom, and only books on the side. For relations that aren&rsquo;t split up like that, you have to put ALL the nodes on both sides.)</p>
<h2 id="equivalent-diagrams">Equivalent diagrams</h2>
<p>We now have three types of diagrams: digraphs, two column tables, and plots.</p>
<p>I want to convince you that these types of diagrams are <em>equivalent</em>: you can convert between them as needed, without losing information.</p>
<p>To convince each other of things, mathematicians write proofs. A &ldquo;proof&rdquo; is a sequence of moves in a board game. The basic moves in the board game are supposed to be so simple that everybody agrees they should be allowed. Bigger, more complicated moves are built up out of simple moves. (In this case, the moves would be things like converting between diagrams.)</p>
<p>Sadly, I can&rsquo;t prove anything yet. I haven&rsquo;t explained any of the basic moves! We&rsquo;ll get to that over the next couple posts. I still want to <em>convince</em> you though. Mathematicians have a classic trick for this:</p>
<div class="centerer">
<p><b>Leave it as an exercise!</b></p>
</div>
<h4 id="exercise-1">Exercise 1</h4>
<p>I want to convince you that digraphs and 2D Plots contain the same information. This means that if we start with a digraph, convert it to a plot, and then convert back, we should end up back where we started.</p>
<p>Get a piece of paper. Divide it into three equal-sized boxes, arranged left to right.</p>
<p>In the left-most box, draw a digraph. Any digraph you like! (If you can&rsquo;t think of one, draw a small bit of your family tree, like above.) Make sure you add a legend.</p>
<p>Convert your diagram to a 2d plot in the middle box. Your starting diagram should look something like the left here, and the middle diagram should look something like the right:</p>

<p>Now, fold your paper over so that you CAN&rsquo;T SEE the digraph you started from. In fact, try to forget where you started from entirely. If you&rsquo;re following along with a friend, trade papers with them at this point.</p>
<p>Now, convert the plot on your paper back into a digraph. This should look something like this:</p>
<div class="center-sequence">
<table class="twodplot">
        <tbody>
            <tr><th rowspan="3" class="right">likes</th>
                <th class="right">A</th>
                    <td><div class="square"></div></td>
                    <td class="selected"><div class="square">X</div></td>
                    <td><div class="square"></div></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th class="right">B</th>
                    <td class="selected"><div class="square">X</div></td>
                    <td><div class="square"></div></td>
                    <td><div class="square"></div></td>
            </tr>   
            <tr>
                <th class="right">C</th>
                    <td><div class="square"></div></td>
                    <td class="selected"><div class="square">X</div></td>
                    <td><div class="square"></div></td>
            </tr>
            <tr><td class="absent"></td><td class="absent"></td><th class="left">A</th><th class="left">B</th><th class="left">C</th></tr>
            <tr><td class="absent"></td><td class="absent"></td><th class="left" colspan="3">liker</th></tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
<div class="center-sequence-fence-post">↦</div>

<p>Remember the legend!</p>
<p>Now we can check if we&rsquo;ve ended up in the same place as we started. Unfold your paper. Check if the starting digraph is the same as the ending digraph.</p>
<p>(Two digraphs are considered to be &ldquo;the same&rdquo; if they have the same nodes and the same connections, even if the nodes are arranged differently. We&rsquo;ll talk more about this in a bit.)</p>
<p>If the start and end of your paper are the same, great. If not, OH NO! You&rsquo;ve proved me wrong!!!</p>
<h4 id="exercise-2">Exercise 2</h4>
<p>There&rsquo;s a second reason we can&rsquo;t prove that tables, plots, and digraphs are all equivalent. It&rsquo;s because that&rsquo;s</p>
<div class="centerer">
<p><b>A COMPLETE LIE!</b></p>
</div>
<p>Specifically, our tables are missing some information right now. To see what I mean, flip your paper over. Draw another small digraph in the leftmost box. Add a node to your digraph that has no edges touching it.</p>
<p>Convert your digraph to a table:</p>
<div class="center-sequence">
<img alt="TODO" src="assets/Comedy_Legend.drawio.svg" class="opaque" width="250pt" height="250pt">
<div class="center-sequence-fence-post">↦</div>
<table class="diagramtable">
        <thead>
            <tr><th class="left">liker</th><th class="right">likes</th></tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr><td>A</td><td>B</td></tr>
            <tr><td>B</td><td>A</td></tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
</div>
<p>Fold the paper again, and remembering that you don&rsquo;t know what the original digraph looked like, convert the table back into a digraph.</p>
<p>Do you see the issue?</p>
<p>If not, here&rsquo;s a hint. This is what I get when I do this exercise:</p>
<div class="center-sequence">
<img alt="TODO" src="assets/Comedy_Legend.drawio.svg" class="opaque" width="250pt" height="250pt">
<div class="center-sequence-fence-post">↦</div>
<table class="diagramtable">
        <thead>
            <tr><th class="left">liker</th><th class="right">likes</th></tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr><td>A</td><td>B</td></tr>
            <tr><td>B</td><td>A</td></tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
<div class="center-sequence-fence-post">↦</div>
    <img alt="TODO" src="assets/Comedy_Bug.drawio.svg" class="opaque" width="250pt" height="250pt">
</div>
<p>The issue is that our tables remember what edges are there, but not what nodes are there. In my example, the node C has no edges, so it doesn&rsquo;t show up in the table at all.</p>
<p>Notice how this issue doesn&rsquo;t show up for digraphs or plots, only tables:</p>
<div class="center-sequence">
<img alt="TODO" src="assets/Comedy_Legend.drawio.svg" class="opaque" width="250pt" height="250pt">
<table class="diagramtable">
        <thead>
            <tr><th class="left">liker</th><th class="right">likes</th></tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr><td>A</td><td>B</td></tr>
            <tr><td>B</td><td>A</td></tr>
        </tbody>
</table>
<table class="twodplot">
        <tbody>
            <tr><th rowspan="3" class="right">likes</th>
                <th class="right">A</th>
                    <td><div class="square"></div></td>
                    <td class="selected"><div class="square">X</div></td>
                    <td><div class="square"></div></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th class="right">B</th>
                    <td class="selected"><div class="square">X</div></td>
                    <td><div class="square"></div></td>
                    <td><div class="square"></div></td>
            </tr>   
            <tr>
                <th class="right">C</th>
                    <td><div class="square"></div></td>
                    <td><div class="square"></div></td>
                    <td><div class="square"></div></td>
            </tr>
            <tr><td class="absent"></td><td class="absent"></td><th class="left">A</th><th class="left">B</th><th class="left">C</th></tr>
            <tr><td class="absent"></td><td class="absent"></td><th class="left" colspan="3">liker</th></tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
</div>
<p>To fix this, we need to add information to our tables to make clear which nodes are <em>possible</em> in each column, even if they aren&rsquo;t actually there.
Something like this:</p>
<div class="center-sequence">
<table class="diagramtable">
        <thead>
            <tr><th class="left">liker: Person</th><th class="right">likes: Person</th></tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr><td>A</td><td>B</td></tr>
            <tr><td>B</td><td>A</td></tr>
        </tbody>
</table>
<table class="diagramtable">
        <thead>
            <tr><th class="left">Person</th></tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr><td>A</td></tr>
            <tr><td>B</td></tr>
            <tr><td>C</td></tr>
        </tbody>
</table>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;liker: Person&rdquo; means that every entry in the column &ldquo;liker&rdquo; has to come from the table &ldquo;Person&rdquo;. A mathematician would say:</p>
<div class="centerer">
<p><b>Every liker is an element of the set Person.</b></p>
</div>
<p>Or, if they&rsquo;re trendy:</p>
<div class="centerer">
<p><b>Every liker is of type Person.</b></p>
</div>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the same idea, applied to our other running example:</p>
<div class="center-sequence-column">
<div class="center-sequence">
    <table class="diagramtable">
        <thead>
            <tr><th class="left">class: Class</th><th class="right">book: Book</th></tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr><td>English Lit 101</td><td>Hamlet</td></tr>
            <tr><td>English Lit 101</td><td>Moby Dick</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Whaling 101</td><td>Moby Dick</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Math 203</td><td>The Calculus Reader</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Astronomy 101</td><td>The Planetary System</td></tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

        <tbody>
            <tr><td>English Lit 101</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Whaling 101</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Math 203</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Astronomy 101</td></tr>
        </tbody>

            <tr><td>Moby Dick</td></tr>
            <tr><td>The Calculus Reader</td></tr>
            <tr><td>The Planetary System</td></tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

</div>
<p>Notice how the columns have different types. What property does this correspond to?</p>
<p>(Remark: the real world isn&rsquo;t neatly divided into &ldquo;types&rdquo; like this. They&rsquo;re just an organizational tool.)</p>
<h2 id="equality--stretchiness">Equality &amp; Stretchiness</h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s one more thing I want to cover in this post. Before, I said that two digraphs are considered to be &ldquo;the same&rdquo; if they have the same nodes and the same connections, even if the nodes are arranged differently.</p>
<p>A more intuitive way to explain this is to say that:</p>
<div class="centerer">
<p><b>Digraphs are stretchy.</b></p>
</div>
<p>So for instance, we would consider these three digraphs to be the same, because we can rearrange and stretch them into each other:</p>
<div class="centerer">
<img alt="TODO" src="assets/Three_Same.drawio.svg" width="500pt">
</div>
<p>To write down that two things are the same, we put an equals sign between them:</p>
<div class="centerer">
<img alt="TODO" src="assets/Three_Equal.drawio.svg" width="500pt">
</div>
<p>(We could also use a three-directional equal sign:</p>
<div class="centerer">
<img alt="TODO" src="assets/Threeary_Equal.drawio.svg" width="500pt">
</div>
<p>But we haven&rsquo;t talked about ternary relations yet.)</p>
<p>It might seem a little strange to put an equals sign between things that aren&rsquo;t <em>exactly</em> the same. But we actually do this all the time in math. Consider the equation:</p>
<div class="center-sequence">
<p class="big">1 + 1</p><div class="center-sequence-fence-post">=</div><p class="big">2</p>
</div>
<p>The things on either side of the equal sign here aren&rsquo;t exactly the same &ndash; they&rsquo;re just <em>the same enough for our purposes</em>. You could also think of them as <em>different ways to accomplish the same thing.</em> To get a &ldquo;2&rdquo;, you can take two &ldquo;1&quot;s and add them together, or you can just write down a &ldquo;2&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In the case of our digraphs, we consider the above diagrams to be <em>different ways to draw the same digraph</em>. Since the digraph is stretchy, it doesn&rsquo;t matter how it&rsquo;s laid out in space.</p>
<p>We can come up with similar rules for our other diagram types. For example, I declare that our tables are unordered: we agree not to care about the order of the rows. So we can write:</p>
<div class="center-sequence">
<table class="diagramtable">
        <thead>
            <tr><th class="left">liker: Person</th><th class="right">likes: Person</th></tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr><td>A</td><td>B</td></tr>
            <tr><td>B</td><td>A</td></tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
<div class="center-sequence-fence-post">=</div>
<table class="diagramtable">
        <thead>
            <tr><th class="left">liker: Person</th><th class="right">likes: Person</th></tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr><td>B</td><td>A</td></tr>
            <tr><td>A</td><td>B</td></tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
</div>
<p><strong>Exercise</strong>. Come up with two 2D plots that look different, but convey the same information. Write an equals sign between them.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So far we&rsquo;ve only talked about binary relations. What about functions?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to formally define them yet, but here&rsquo;s a taste of where we&rsquo;re going. Suppose we have a bunch of number-terms &ndash; things like &ldquo;1 + 1&rdquo;, &ldquo;9 - 6&rdquo;, &ldquo;(5 + 7) / 3&rdquo;:</p>
<div class="centerer">
<img alt="TODO" src="assets/Terms_Bare.drawio.svg" width="250pt">
</div>
<p>I like to picture an endless wall of these, stretching off into the distance:</p>
<div class="centerer">
<img alt="TODO" src="assets/CircleWall.png" width="700pt">
</div>
<p>That&rsquo;s hard to draw though.</p>
<p>In elementary school, we&rsquo;re taught to <em>evaluate</em> number-terms &ndash; to convert them to <em>values</em>, that is, numbers.</p>
<p>We can draw this:</p>
<div class="centerer">
<img alt="TODO" src="assets/Terms_Eval.svg" width="450pt">
</div>
<p>There&rsquo;s another way to think about this situation (which becomes more important when you get to algebra). Instead of fully evaluating terms, we just ask whether or not they&rsquo;re equal to each other. This looks like:</p>
<div class="centerer">
<img alt="TODO" src="assets/Terms_Equal.svg" width="450pt">
</div>
<p>(The loops might seem odd, but they&rsquo;re part of how equality is usually defined.)</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s combine these pictures:</p>
<div class="centerer">
<img alt="TODO" src="assets/Terms_Equal_Eval.svg" width="500pt">
</div>
<p>(Ignore the overlapping edges. Really, this oughtta be a 3-dimensional diagram. You could make it with spaghetti and marshmallows&hellip;)</p>
<p>Now, compare:</p>
<div class="centerer">
<img alt="A diagram with some purple balls on the left and orange squares on the right. The balls and squares are grouped into highlighted regions. Each region contains multiple balls, but only one square. All balls are contained in a region, but some squares are on their own." src="assets/Functions.drawio.svg" width="324pt" height="324pt">
</div>
<p>This is that vague picture I drew at the beginning. It&rsquo;s what I think a function looks like.</p>
<p>You might see some connection between these diagrams. Right now, it&rsquo;s wordless. The rest of this series will be spent making it precise.</p>
<p>Functions are ubiquitous in pure math. They have a simple definition, but are used in all sorts of ways. Functions can be used for:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>computing</strong></li>
<li><strong>labeling</strong></li>
<li><strong>grouping</strong></li>
<li><strong>forgetting</strong></li>
<li><strong>embedding</strong></li>
<li><strong>rearranging</strong></li>
<li>&hellip;and more.</li>
</ul>
<p>We&rsquo;ll learn how to unpack the definition of functions to see the rich structure it implies. We&rsquo;ll do this intuitively &ndash; with lots of pictures &ndash; to feel comfortable and confident in our understanding. But we&rsquo;ll also do it formally: we&rsquo;ll learn how to express our understanding as moves in a strict board game, to double-check our intuition and share it with others.</p>

  <summary>Note for mathematicians (don't read this if you're not a mathematician!!)</summary>
<p>We&rsquo;ll be proving the &ldquo;trivial homomorphism theorem&rdquo;: &ldquo;Input-total equality-preserving binary relations are bijections between a partition of their domain and a subset of their codomain.&rdquo; We&rsquo;ll work with a mixture of classical and diagrammatic first-order logic. The diagrammatic logic will be an n-ary generalization of binary relation algebras <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relation_algebra">[6]</a> viewed as strict 2-categories, using spiders <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX-calculus">[7]</a> <a href="https://graphicallinearalgebra.net/">[8]</a> to represent relational joins.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll leave you with a parting&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="exercise">Exercise</h2>
<p>Draw a table with 3 columns. For example:</p>
<div class="centerer">
<pre>(suspect: Suspect, murder_weapon: Item, location: Room)</pre>
</div>
<p>For ease of drawing, only give it 2 or 3 rows. Make sure you add secondary tables listing the possible Suspects, Items, and Rooms.</p>
<p>Convert your table to a <em>3-D plot</em>. A 3D-plot can be drawn like this:</p>
<div class="centerer">
<img alt="TODO" src="assets/Cube.svg" class="opaque" width="200pt">
</div>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t like 3D drawing, there&rsquo;s another way to draw 3D plots that doesn&rsquo;t require drawing any cubes. Pretend you&rsquo;ve got a deli slicer.</p>
<p>Next, convert your table to a <em>directed triangular hypergraph</em>. This sounds scarier than it is. It&rsquo;s a lot like a digraph &ndash; you draw the nodes the same way, but the edges go between THREE nodes at a time. Here are two ways to draw triangular edges:</p>
<div class="centerer">
<img alt="TODO" src="assets/Hyperedge.svg"width="500pt">
</div>
<p>(&ldquo;Spider&rdquo; is really the official math name for this shape, but it makes more sense when they&rsquo;ve got more legs&hellip;)</p>
<p>(Once you&rsquo;ve drawn it, can you rearrange your hypergraph to look similar to your 3D plot?)</p>
<h2 id="bonus-exercise">Bonus Exercise</h2>
<p>Draw a table with 4 columns. Contemplate the mess you&rsquo;ve gotten yourself into.</p>
<p>Hint: a line of cubes is like a square of squares.</p>
