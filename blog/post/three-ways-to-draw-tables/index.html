<p>This post is about three types of diagram:</p>
<div class="centerer">
<img src="assets/Three_Diagrams.svg" width="600pt">
</div>
<p>These look different, but they&rsquo;re really just different ways to convey the same information. We&rsquo;ll learn how to convert back and forth between them, which is a handy skill if you spot them in the wild.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a fancy name for these diagrams. If you want to impress people, you can call them all <span class="introvocab">Binary Relation Diagrams</span>. You could also just call them <span class="introvocab">Relations</span>. (I&rsquo;ll be saying <span class="introvocab">Relations</span> a lot, because I want to save the word &ldquo;Table&rdquo; specifically for the middle diagram type.)</p>
<p>(Note: This post is the first in a series. The series will be about relations, and also about a special kind of relation called a <span class="introvocab">Function</span>. My overall goal is to convince you that <em>functions look like this</em>:</p>
<div class="centerer">
<img alt="A diagram with some balls on the left and squares on the right. The balls and squares are grouped into highlighted regions. Each region contains multiple balls, but only one square. All balls are contained in a region, but some squares are on their own." src="assets/Functions.drawio.svg" width="324pt" height="324pt">
</div>
<p>Later in the series, we&rsquo;ll talk about connections between diagrams, math, programming, and databases. We&rsquo;ll see how these different fields study similar subject matter in very different ways, and learn how to translate between them.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry though. This post is standalone, and it won&rsquo;t have any math in it. Only pictures :)</p>
<!--
People think math is boring and hard to understand. They're right, but I wish they weren't.

The thing is, math is *basically* just a pen-and-paper board game. The rules of math are carefully designed to simulate the real world. It's not magic.

But people don't usually get taught *why* math works the way it does, at least until they get to college. In school, you just get handed a bunch of rules to memorize. I don't know about you, but I can't learn that way.

There's a number of people working on making friendly and intuitive math resources ([[1]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDofhN-RJqg&list=PLRq5rHXCLP_uFOJrIYGpaKs8uj2OMpqjt) [[2]](https://betterexplained.com/archives/) [[3]](https://graphicallinearalgebra.net/) [[4]](https://archive.org/details/the-visual-display-of-quantitative-information-2ed-by-tufte-edward-r.-z-lib.org)). I think these resources are especially needed for "pure", "professional" math. Professional math seems scary, but that's just because it usually isn't explained very well. It's a big board game! Among other things.

We'll get an intuitive understanding of what this means, and learn how to *prove* it -- how to use it as a strategy in the game of formal math, if a pro mathematician challenges you to a duel.

Let's begin.

<h2 id="the-nitty-gritty">The Nitty Gritty</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go through our three ways to draw relation diagrams.</p>
<!-- First, we need to define our playing pieces. The most basic piece we'll use is called a <span class="introvocab">binary relation</span>. Instead of starting with strict, by-the-book rules, let's keep it relaxed, and try to get a general sense of what relations look like. There are multiple ways to draw them, but they're all connected. -->
<h3 id="diagram-type-one-directed-graphs">Diagram type one: Directed Graphs</h3>
<p>Our first kind of diagram is my favorite. It&rsquo;s called a &ldquo;directed graph&rdquo;, or <span class="introvocab">digraph</span>, and it looks like this:</p>
<!-- SCALE: drawio 1in -> 108pt --> 
<div class="centerer">
<img alt="Circles labeled 1,2,3,4. There are arrows going 1 to 2, 1 to 3, 3 to 4, 4 to 1" src="assets/R_Graph1.svg" width="324pt" height="324pt">
</div>
<p>A digraph is a collection of <span class="introvocab">nodes</span> &ndash; labeled circles &ndash; and a collection of <span class="introvocab">edges</span> &ndash; little arrows going between the nodes. We can model all sorts of situations with digraphs. For instance, a family tree can be represented as a digraph. We draw a node for each person, then draw edges from parents to children:</p>
<div class="centerer">
<img alt="Circles labeled Cindy,Felix,Ray,Eileen,Rob,Louise,Jim,Mac. There are arrows going Cindy to Rob, Felix to Rob, Ray to Louise, Eileen to Louise, Rob to Jim, Rob to Mac, Louise to Jim, Louise to Mac" width="432pt" src="assets/Family_Digraph_1.svg">
</div>
<p>We can also draw digraphs of love triangles, by drawing edges from people to people they like:</p>
<div class="centerer">
<img alt="TODO" src="assets/Love Triangles.svg" width="756pt">
</div>
<p>Notice that nodes are allowed to have edges to themselves. Also, nodes don&rsquo;t have to have any edges. In the &ldquo;Romantic Comedy&rdquo; example, C is a sidekick who&rsquo;s not interested in A or B.</p>
<p>(At least, that&rsquo;s one way to interpret the diagram. It doesn&rsquo;t really say anything besides who likes who.)</p>
<p>Relations don&rsquo;t have to be about relationships between people. For example, we could draw a digraph of which classes use which books in a school:</p>
<div class="centerer">
<img alt="TODO" class="extrapad" src="assets/Classes_Regular_Arrows.drawio.svg" width="648pt">
</div>
<p>Notice how this digraph is divided into two parts &ndash; the classes and the books. All the edges go from classes to books. Digraphs like this are called <span class="introvocab">bipartite</span>, which means &ldquo;two parts&rdquo;.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have to use arrows to draw our digraph edges. We can use any shape we want, as long as the ends look different. For instance, we could use different colored circles:</p>
<div class="centerer">
<img alt="TODO" class="extrapad" src="assets/Classes_Multi_Arrows.drawio.svg" width="648pt">
</div>
<p>Or even add text labels:</p>
<div class="centerer">
<img alt="TODO" class="extrapad" src="assets/Classes_Multi_Arrows_2.drawio.svg" width="648pt">
</div>
<p>I like this because it&rsquo;s very clear what the edges mean. It&rsquo;s a lot of work to add all the labels though.
We can compromise by adding a legend:</p>
<div class="centerer">
<img alt="TODO" class="extrapad" src="assets/Classes_Multi_Arrows_Legend.drawio.svg" width="648pt">
</div>
<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve added legends, it&rsquo;s very easy to convert to our next way to draw relations: tables.</p>
<h3 id="diagram-type-two-two-column-tables">Diagram Type Two: Two-Column Tables</h3>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the class-book relation, redrawn as a <span class="introvocab">Two-Column Table</span>. We use the labels from the legend as column titles.</p>
<div class="centerer">
    <table class="diagramtable">
        <thead>
            <tr><th class="left">class</th><th class="right">book</th></tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr><td>English Lit 101</td><td>Hamlet</td></tr>
            <tr><td>English Lit 101</td><td>Moby Dick</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Whaling 101</td><td>Moby Dick</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Math 203</td><td>The Calculus Reader</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Astronomy 101</td><td>The Planetary System</td></tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
</div>
<p>This is less exciting, but more orderly.</p>
<p>We can also convert our other graphs into tables. For instance we can take the &ldquo;Coveting&rdquo; graph from before, add a legend, and convert it to a table:</p>
<div class="center-sequence">
<img alt="TODO" src="assets/Coveting_Legend.svg" class="opaque" width="250pt" height="250pt">
<div class="center-sequence-fence-post">↦</div>
<table class="diagramtable">
        <thead>
            <tr><th class="left">person</th><th class="right">likes</th></tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr><td>A</td><td>B</td></tr>
            <tr><td>B</td><td>A</td></tr>
            <tr><td>C</td><td>B</td></tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
</div>
<p>Look at this for a minute to make sure you understand the translation.
If it helps, you can compare the &ldquo;Pining&rdquo; graph:</p>
<div class="center-sequence">
<img alt="TODO" src="assets/Pining_Legend.svg" class="opaque" width="250pt" height="250pt">
<div class="center-sequence-fence-post">↦</div>
<table class="diagramtable">
        <thead>
            <tr><th class="left">person</th><th class="right">likes</th></tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr><td>A</td><td>B</td></tr>
            <tr><td>B</td><td>A</td></tr>
            <tr><td>B</td><td>C</td></tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
</div>
<p>Notice how the last row swaps direction, just like the last edge swaps direction.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one more way to draw relations&hellip;</p>
<h3 id="diagram-type-three-2d-plots">Diagram Type Three: 2D Plots</h3>
<p>This diagram type makes better use of 2D space. Here&rsquo;s the Coveting relation again, now drawn as a <span class="introvocab">2D Plot</span>:</p>
<div class="center-sequence">
<img alt="TODO" src="assets/Coveting_Legend.svg" class="opaque" width="250pt" height="250pt">
<table class="diagramtable">
        <thead>
            <tr><th class="left">person</th><th class="right">likes</th></tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr><td>A</td><td>B</td></tr>
            <tr><td>B</td><td>A</td></tr>
            <tr><td>C</td><td>B</td></tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
<table class="twodplot">
        <tbody>
            <tr><th rowspan="3" class="right">likes</th>
                <th class="right">A</th>
                    <td><div class="square"></div></td>
                    <td class="selected"><div class="square">X</div></td>
                    <td><div class="square"></div></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th class="right">B</th>
                    <td class="selected"><div class="square">X</div></td>
                    <td><div class="square"></div></td>
                    <td class="selected"><div class="square">X</div></td>
            </tr>   
            <tr>
                <th class="right">C</th>
                    <td><div class="square"></div></td>
                    <td><div class="square"></div></td>
                    <td><div class="square"></div></td>
            </tr>
            <tr><td class="absent"></td><td class="absent"></td><th class="left">A</th><th class="left">B</th><th class="left">C</th></tr>
            <tr><td class="absent"></td><td class="absent"></td><th class="left" colspan="3">person</th></tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
</div>
<p>You might notice that this diagram type flips the columns around. This is on purpose. It&rsquo;s because positions in a 2D plot are traditionally written <strong>(horizontal, vertical)</strong> or <strong>(x, y)</strong>. Since our relation is <strong>(person, likes)</strong>, I&rsquo;ve laid out the <strong>person</strong> column horizontal and left the <strong>likes</strong> column vertical.</p>
<p>Compare Coveting with Pining:</p>
<div class="center-sequence">
<img alt="TODO" src="assets/Pining_Legend.svg" class="opaque" width="250pt" height="250pt">
<table class="diagramtable">

        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr><td>A</td><td>B</td></tr>
            <tr><td>B</td><td>A</td></tr>
            <tr><td>B</td><td>C</td></tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
<table class="twodplot">
        <tbody>
            <tr><th rowspan="3" class="right">likes</th>

                    <td><div class="square"></div></td>
                    <td class="selected"><div class="square">X</div></td>
                    <td><div class="square"></div></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th class="right">B</th>
                    <td class="selected"><div class="square">X</div></td>
                    <td><div class="square"></div></td>
                    <td><div class="square"></div></td>
            </tr>   
            <tr>
                <th class="right">C</th>
                    <td><div class="square"></div></td>
                    <td class="selected"><div class="square">X</div></td>
                    <td><div class="square"></div></td>
            </tr>
            <tr><td class="absent"></td><td class="absent"></td><th class="left">A</th><th class="left">B</th><th class="left">C</th></tr>
            <tr><td class="absent"></td><td class="absent"></td><th class="left" colspan="3">person</th></tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
</div>
<p>Let&rsquo;s apply this to our classes-books relation:</p>
<div class="center-sequence-column">

<p>(We&rsquo;ve used a trick here to take up less space. Because the class-books relation is bipartite &ndash; split into classes and books &ndash; we can put only classes on the bottom, and only books on the side. For relations that aren&rsquo;t split up like that, you have to put ALL the nodes on both sides.)</p>
<h2 id="equivalent-diagrams">Equivalent diagrams</h2>
<p>We now have three ways to draw relations: <span class="introvocab">Digraphs</span>, <span class="introvocab">Two-Column Tables</span>, and <span class="introvocab">2D Plots</span>.</p>
<p>I want to convince you that these types of diagrams are <em>equivalent</em>: you can convert between them as needed, without losing information.</p>
<p>If this post were about <em>formal</em> math, this is where I would write you a <span class="introvocab">proof</span>. See, to convince each other of things, mathematicians write &ldquo;proofs&rdquo;. A &ldquo;proof&rdquo; is a strategy in a board game. The basic moves in the board game are supposed to be really simple. So simple, that everybody agrees they should be allowed. Bigger strategies are built up out of simple moves. (In this case, the moves would be things like converting between diagrams.)</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to explain a bunch of formal game rules here &ndash; they can get pretty dry. But I still want to convince you like I&rsquo;d convince a mathematician. See, mathematicians have a high bar to be &ldquo;convinced&rdquo; of things. If you tell them something &ldquo;works&rdquo;, they&rsquo;ll ask <em>how</em> it works. They&rsquo;ll also ask what <span class="introvocab">conditions</span> need to be met for it to work. And usually, they&rsquo;ll want to try it out for themselves.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not doing math here, but we <em>are</em> talking about diagrams. So far I&rsquo;ve been drawing all of them. Why not try drawing some yourself?</p>
<h4 id="drawing-exercise-1">Drawing Exercise 1</h4>
<p>I want to convince you that <span class="introvocab">Digraphs</span> and <span class="introvocab">2D Plots</span> contain the same information. This means that if we:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start with a <span class="introvocab">Digraph</span></li>
<li>Convert it to a <span class="introvocab">2D Plot</span></li>
<li>Convert it <em>back</em> to a <span class="introvocab">Digraph</span></li>
</ol>
<p>We should end up back where we started. Let&rsquo;s test this.</p>
<p>Get a piece of paper. Divide it up into boxes like this:</p>
<div class="center-sequence">
<img alt="TODO" src="assets/Exercise_setup.svg" width="500pt">
</div>
<p>We&rsquo;ll fill in the top row first.</p>
<p>In the <strong>Start</strong> box, draw a <span class="introvocab">Digraph</span>. Any digraph you want! For example, you could draw a bit of your family tree, or a love triangle you came up with. For my technique to work, I&rsquo;ll request that you meet these <span class="introvocab">conditions</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li>All your nodes have different labels.</li>
<li>None of your nodes overlap, or cover each other entirely.</li>
<li>You draw at most one arrow from any start node to any end node.</li>
</ul>
<p>(That last condition means that 🅐⇉🅑 isn&rsquo;t allowed, but 🅐⇋🅑 is.)</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve drawn your digraph, convert it to a <span class="introvocab">2D Plot</span> in the <strong>Middle</strong> box, like this:</p>
<div class="center-sequence">
<div class="inner-column">

                        <td><div class="square"></div></td>

                        <td><div class="square"></div></td>
                        <td><div class="square"></div></td>
                </tr>   
                <tr>

                        <td class="selected"><div class="square">X</div></td>
                        <td><div class="square"></div></td>

<p>Now, fold your paper over so that you CAN&rsquo;T SEE the digraph you started from. (If you&rsquo;re following along with a friend, trade papers with them at this point.)</p>
<p>Now, convert the 2D plot in your <strong>Middle</strong> box back to a digraph in your <strong>End</strong> box. Try drawing the nodes in different places :)</p>

<p>Unfold your paper. Now, we can check if the starting digraph is the same as the ending digraph&ndash; oh, wait!</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an important rule I haven&rsquo;t explained yet.</p>
<div class="centerer">
<p><b>Digraphs are stretchy.</b></p>
</div>
<p>This means that no matter how we stretch and rearrange a digraph, as long as we don&rsquo;t add or break any edges, it will still be considered &ldquo;the same digraph&rdquo;. So, for example, all of these would be considered &ldquo;the same&rdquo;:</p>
<div class="centerer">
<img alt="TODO" src="assets/Three_Same.svg" width="500pt">
</div>
<p><em>Keeping in mind</em> that this is what &ldquo;the same&rdquo; means for digraphs, check if your <strong>Start</strong> and <strong>End</strong> boxes are the same.</p>
<details>
<summary>If they are the same, click here:</summary>
<p>Great. You&rsquo;ve completed the exercise.</p>
<p>This might feel a little anticlimactic. What, we&rsquo;re just back where we started? What was the point of this?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how <em>you</em> feel. Me, I&rsquo;m wiping sweat off my brow. See, I made kinda a big promise back there. I told you that my procedure would work, <em>no matter what</em> digraph you chose. Lucky me, you picked one where it seems to have worked. If you could find one where it didn&rsquo;t work, you would have officially PROVEN ME WRONG.</p>
<p>Specifically, you&rsquo;d have found a COUNTEREXAMPLE to my claim that my procedure would work for any input. Counterexamples are a time-honored technique for proving over-broad claims wrong. For example:</p>
<div class="centerer">
<p><b>Plato:</b> Any featherless biped <i>must</i> be a man.</p>
</div>
<div class="centerer">
<p><b>Diogenes (holding up a plucked chicken):</b> Behold a man!</p>
</div>
<p>In modern times, finding a counterexample to somebody&rsquo;s claim means you get to publish a paper making fun of them.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>If they aren't the same, click here:</summary>
<p>There are two possibilities:</p>
<ol>
<li>An error happened somewhere.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m wrong, and you&rsquo;ve found a counterexample.</li>
</ol>
<p>First, we should check for errors. Go over each edge in the <strong>Start</strong> box, make sure it&rsquo;s recorded as a black square in the <strong>Middle</strong> box, and turned back into an edge in the <strong>End</strong> box. You might also want to check that none of the squares in the <strong>Middle</strong> box got filled in black when they shouldn&rsquo;t have been.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t find any errors, you may have found a genuine counterexample. Please cite me in your refutation paper.</p>

<h4 id="drawing-exercise-2">Drawing Exercise 2</h4>
<p>We&rsquo;ve just converted a digraph to a 2D plot and back. Can we convert a digraph to a table and back?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s try this in the next row. This time, let me pick our starting diagram. Draw this in the <strong>Start</strong> box:</p>
<div class="center-sequence">
<div class="inner-column">
    <b>Start</b>
    <img alt="TODO" src="assets/Comedy_Legend.svg" class="opaque" width="250pt" height="250pt">
</div>
<div class="center-sequence-fence-post">↦</div>
</div>
<p>Now, convert this to a Table in the <strong>Middle</strong> box.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>Hmm. Wait a minute. What table should we draw here?</p>
<p>Come up with <em>something</em> and we can compare notes in a sec.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>Here are some ideas I came up with:</p>
<div class="center-sequence">
<div class="inner-column">
<b>Idea 1</b>
<table class="diagramtable">
        <thead>
            <tr><th class="left">person</th><th class="right">likes</th></tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr><td>A</td><td>B</td></tr>
            <tr><td>B</td><td>A</td></tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
</div>
<div class="inner-column">
    <b>Idea 2</b>
    <table class="diagramtable">
        <thead>
            <tr><th class="left">person</th><th class="right">likes</th></tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr><td>A</td><td>B</td></tr>
            <tr><td>B</td><td>A</td></tr>
            <tr><td>C</td><td></td></tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
</div>
<div class="inner-column">
    <b>Idea 3</b>
    <table class="diagramtable">
        <thead>
            <tr><th class="left">person</th><th class="right">likes</th></tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr><td>A</td><td>B</td></tr>
            <tr><td>B</td><td>A</td></tr>
            <tr><td>C</td><td></td></tr>
            <tr><td></td><td>C</td></tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    </div>
</div>
<p>The problem is that C doesn&rsquo;t have any edges, so it&rsquo;s not exactly clear how we should record it in the table.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve come to a <strong>design decision</strong>. Let&rsquo;s consider our options.</p>
<p>I think <strong>Idea 1</strong> is definitely wrong. It&rsquo;s missing information &ndash; if we picked it, our exercise could end up like this:</p>
<div class="center-sequence">
<img alt="TODO" src="assets/Comedy_Legend.svg" class="opaque" width="250pt" height="250pt">
<div class="center-sequence-fence-post">↦</div>
<table class="diagramtable">
        <thead>
            <tr><th class="left">person</th><th class="right">likes</th></tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr><td>A</td><td>B</td></tr>
            <tr><td>B</td><td>A</td></tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <div class="center-sequence-fence-post">↦</div>
    <img alt="TODO" src="assets/Comedy_Bug.svg" class="opaque" width="250pt" height="250pt">
</div>
<p>Because the table is missing information, we don&rsquo;t end up back where we started.</p>
<p>Of the other two&hellip;</p>
<div class="center-sequence">
<div class="inner-column">
    <b>Idea 2</b>
    <table class="diagramtable">
        <thead>
            <tr><th class="left">person</th><th class="right">likes</th></tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr><td>A</td><td>B</td></tr>
            <tr><td>B</td><td>A</td></tr>
            <tr><td>C</td><td></td></tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
</div>
<div class="inner-column">
    <b>Idea 3</b>
    <table class="diagramtable">
        <thead>
            <tr><th class="left">person</th><th class="right">likes</th></tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr><td>A</td><td>B</td></tr>
            <tr><td>B</td><td>A</td></tr>
            <tr><td>C</td><td></td></tr>
            <tr><td></td><td>C</td></tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    </div>
</div>
<p>I think I like <strong>Idea 3</strong> the most:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Idea 2</strong> says &ldquo;C doesn&rsquo;t like anybody&rdquo;.</li>
<li><strong>Idea 3</strong> says &ldquo;C doesn&rsquo;t like anybody, and nobody likes C&rdquo;,</li>
</ul>
<p>which is more information. Sorry C.</p>
<p>Are there other options? Well, yes. There is actually a <strong>Standard Math Answer</strong> to this question. It might seem a little odd at first. Here&rsquo;s what a mathematician would draw:</p>
<div class="center-sequence">
<table class="diagramtable">
        <thead>
            <tr><th class="left">person: People</th><th class="right">likes: People</th></tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr><td>A</td><td>B</td></tr>
            <tr><td>B</td><td>A</td></tr>
        </tbody>
</table>
<table class="diagramtable">
        <thead>
            <tr><th class="left">People</th></tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr><td>A</td></tr>
            <tr><td>B</td></tr>
            <tr><td>C</td></tr>
        </tbody>
</table>
</div>
<p>We&rsquo;ve split our information into TWO tables. One table lists the nodes (People), and the other lists the edges.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<strong>person: People</strong>&rdquo; means that every entry in the column &ldquo;<strong>person</strong>&rdquo; has to come from the table &ldquo;<strong>People</strong>&rdquo;. You can also say:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;each person is in the set People&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>or</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;each person is of type People&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>
<p>(This will sound familiar to programmers.)</p>
<p>We can remix our other running example to show off the same idea:</p>
<div class="center-sequence-column">
<img alt="TODO" src="assets/Classes_Barbells_Gym.svg" class="opaque" width="550pt">
<div class="center-sequence-column-fence-post">↦</div>
<div class="center-sequence">
    <table class="diagramtable">
        <thead>
            <tr><th class="left">class: Classes</th><th class="right">book: Books</th></tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr><td>English Lit 101</td><td>Hamlet</td></tr>
            <tr><td>English Lit 101</td><td>Moby Dick</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Whaling 101</td><td>Moby Dick</td></tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
</div>
<div class="center-sequence">
    <table class="diagramtable">
        <thead>
            <tr><th class="left">Classes</th></tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr><td>English Lit 101</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Whaling 101</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Gym Class</td></tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <table class="diagramtable">
        <thead>
            <tr><th class="left">Books</th></tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr><td>Hamlet</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Moby Dick</td></tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
</div>
</div>
<!--(Notice how the columns have DIFFERENT types in this example. The Books table seems kinda redundant here, but that redundancy will turn out to be useful later.)-->  
<p>Okay, we still need to finish our exercise. What do we put in the Middle box? You actually have a choice here: <strong>Idea 3</strong> and the <strong>Standard Math Answer</strong> will work equally well. Which one you pick comes down to personal preference and who you hang out with.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mathematicians usually pick the <strong>Standard Math Answer</strong>.</li>
<li>Database programmers use <strong>Idea 3</strong>. They call it an <strong>OUTER JOIN</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>(In capital letters. Database programming started in the 70s, when capital letters were still cool.)</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve made your choice, finish the exercise like last time. Did you end up back where you started?</p>
<!-- (Remark: the real world isn't neatly divided into "types". They're just an organizational tool.) -->
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Now maybe you are starting to be convinced that these:</p>
<div class="centerer">
<img src="assets/Three_Diagrams.svg" width="600pt">
</div>
<p>Are the same. Hooray?</p>
<p>Still, you might be wondering: <em>why are they the same, really</em>?</p>
<p>In my opinion it is because <em>digraphs are stretchy</em>. All of these pictures should be understood as pictures of the <em>same</em> stretchy digraph, just with some parts drawn in different ways.</p>
<p>Here, let me show you:</p>
<div class="centerer">
<img src="assets/Three_Diagrams_Detailed.svg" width="700pt">
</div>
<p>The tildes (~) mean &ldquo;is like&rdquo;, which is pretty vague, so I hope you can see what I mean.
I think the strangest part of this diagram is the transformation on the left side &ndash; modifying a graph by duplicating nodes.
Once you accept that part, the rest is pretty straightforward.</p>
<p>(John Von Neumann once said: &ldquo;Young man, in mathematics you don&rsquo;t understand things. You just get used to them.&rdquo;)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll leave you with a parting</p>
<h2 id="exercise">Exercise</h2>
<p>Flip your paper over. Draw a 2-column table. Rather than trying to come up with a situation, just name the columns &ldquo;a&rdquo; and &ldquo;b&rdquo;, and fill the table with random numbers and letters. Not too many of them, or you&rsquo;ll be here all day.</p>
<p>Aren&rsquo;t you curious what digraph you&rsquo;ve created? Convert your table to a digraph &ndash; watch it unfold. Try rearranging the nodes to see other forms it might take.</p>
<p>Also, try drawing it as a 2D plot. Honestly, this will probably just look like TV static, but it&rsquo;s good to practice.</p>
